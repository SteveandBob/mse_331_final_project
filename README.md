# mse_331_final_project

Required packages:
gurobipy
numpy
pandas

To run the script, it is simply python mse_331_project_solver.py.

The model is too large to run with no license so download the license i posted in the discord and save it to the path i mention.
After that you should be able to run the script no problem.
