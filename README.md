Required packages:

To run the script, it is simply python mse_331_project_solver.py.

The model is too large to run with no license so go to https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059842732-How-do-I-set-up-a-license-without-installing-the-full-Gurobi-package and download the license_tools.exe for your platform and run the license command i provided in the discord.
Save the license in the default folder it selects and then you should be able to run the script no problem
